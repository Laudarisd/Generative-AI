# üß™ Generative AI: Diffusion Models

Welcome to the **Diffusion Models** repository ‚Äî a deep dive into one of the most powerful generative modeling techniques in modern AI. This repo is designed as a learning and research resource to understand, experiment with, and implement diffusion models from the ground up.

---

## üìö Overview

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by reversing a gradual noising process. They have become state-of-the-art in image synthesis (e.g., **Stable Diffusion**, **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models**), outperforming GANs in both stability and fidelity.

This repository covers:

- Theoretical foundations and intuition
- Mathematical formulation
- Implementation from scratch
- Comparisons with other generative models
- Advanced variants (e.g., DDIM, Score-based models, Latent Diffusion)
- Experimentation and visualization

## 1. Introduction

Diffusion models are built on the idea of gradually corrupting data by adding noise, then learning to reverse this process to generate new samples from pure noise.

Popular Applications:
- Image generation (Stable Diffusion, DALLE-2)
- Audio synthesis (DiffWave)
- Video generation
- 3D model synthesis

## 2. üîç Core Concepts

### Forward Diffusion Process (Noise Schedule)
A Markov chain gradually adds Gaussian noise over T steps:

\[
q(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
\]

- \( \beta_t \): Variance schedule (linear, cosine, etc.)
- \( x_0 \): Original data
- \( x_T \): Pure noise

### Reverse Denoising Process
We train a neural network \( \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \) to estimate the noise:

\[
p_\theta(x_{t-1} \mid x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))
\]

The model learns how to "denoise" \( x_T \to x_0 \) step by step.

## 3. üßÆ Mathematical Foundations

### Variational Lower Bound (ELBO)

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{vlb}} = \mathbb{E}_q \left[ \log \frac{q(x_{1:T} \mid x_0)}{p_\theta(x_{0:T})} \right]
\]

Simplified loss for noise prediction:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{simple}} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, \epsilon, t} \left[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon, t) \|^2 \right]
\]

### Schedule Terms

- \( \alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t \)
- \( \bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t \alpha_s \)
- Cosine and linear schedules influence the learning curve and stability.

## 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms and Implementations

### Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)
- Proposed by Ho et al., 2020
- Key technique: parameterizing the noise directly
- Used in many modern diffusion-based tools

### DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models)
- Deterministic version of DDPM
- Enables faster sampling with fewer steps

### Score-Based Generative Models
- Use the **score function**: the gradient of log-probability
- Solves reverse SDEs
- Example: **Song et al., Score SDEs**

## 5. üöÄ Advanced Topics

- **Classifier-Free Guidance**: Boosts generation quality without explicit labels.
- **Latent Diffusion**: Compress input to latent space ‚Üí apply diffusion ‚Üí decode.
- **Text-to-Image (e.g., Stable Diffusion)**: Use CLIP/T5 embeddings to condition generation.
- **UNet + Time Embeddings**: Common backbone to model diffusion time steps.
- **Memory-efficient training**: Use gradient checkpointing, mixed precision (FP16).
